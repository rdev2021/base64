## Overview

This application allows users to easily encode and decode text using Base64 encoding. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can enter text. 

It runs entirely in the user's browser without sending any input or output data to a server. This means that all text processing occurs locally, ensuring that sensitive information remains private and secure. Users can confidently encode and decode their text without worrying about data leaks or privacy violations. For more info refer privacy page.
